## linode

This package provides the `linode` package which offers
an interface to the Linode API.

It's intentionally designed to make heavy use of built-ins and strings
in place of custom data structures and proper types. It also only implements
specific endpoints, and doesn't have full API coverage.

**For those reasons, I recommend looking elsewhere if you just need
a standard Linode API client.**
